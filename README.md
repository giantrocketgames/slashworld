C++ Source files for my implementation of Stephen Ulibarri's UE5 C++ course

https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-5-the-ultimate-game-developer-course

The source assets are not included as I can't distribute his course content, however you will be able to see the C++ code I've created alongside some recordings from YouTube.
